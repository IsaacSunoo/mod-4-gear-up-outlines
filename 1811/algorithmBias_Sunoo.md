Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Algorithms with learning bias

Introduction of yourself: * Isaac
                          * Full stack engineer
                          * minority

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? Because I believe in creating software that is unbias towards everyone in the human race.

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: The big question right now is if the tech industry is addressing the issues of bias in algorithms and ai being inherently prejudiced and the answer is no.
Warnings that AI and machine learning systems are being trained using “bad data” abound. The oft-touted solution is to ensure that humans train the systems with unbiased data, meaning that humans need to avoid bias themselves. But that would mean tech companies are training their engineers and data scientists on understanding cognitive bias, as well as how to “combat” it. 

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? This connects because here we are taught to code unprejudicaly and unbias.

How will this impact you as a developer? It will make me conscious of the way I code and write out algorithms keeping it bias free and essentially having the software run equivalent for every human.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 1. 2. 3.
Can you think of any companies that don't have any political bias?
Do you think the tech industry is doing enough to address biases?
